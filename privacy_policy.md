# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 20, 2025**

This privacy policy applies to the Attention Arsenal app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Danaid Sinani (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

### What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

**User-Generated Content:**

- The Application stores reminders, tasks, and notes (collectively "Arsenals") that you create
- This content is stored **locally on your device** using Core Data
- No account registration is required
- Your data is never uploaded to our servers

**Calendar Information:**

- If you grant permission, the Application can read your calendar events
- Calendar data is only used to display events within the app and suggest reminders
- Calendar information is **not stored permanently** and is **not sent to external servers**
- You can revoke calendar access at any time in iOS Settings

**Voice Commands (Siri):**

- If you use Siri shortcuts, your voice input is processed by Apple's Siri service
- Voice commands are converted to text and sent to OpenAI's API for natural language processing
- We do not store or have access to your voice recordings

### Third-Party Services

**OpenAI API Integration:**

The Application uses OpenAI's API to provide intelligent features including:

- Parsing natural language voice commands
