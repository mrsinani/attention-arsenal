  - [ ] Data persistence across app launches
  - [ ] Handle edge cases and errors
- [ ] Test notification system
  - [ ] Verify notifications are scheduled correctly
  - [ ] Test different repetition intervals
  - [ ] Ensure notifications are cancelled when appropriate
  - [ ] Test notification permissions and handling
- [ ] Test UI/UX on different devices
  - [ ] iPhone (various sizes)
  - [ ] iPad (if supporting)
  - [ ] Different iOS versions
- [ ] Performance testing
  - [ ] App launch time
  - [ ] List scrolling performance
  - [ ] Memory usage

## Phase 8: Final Polish and Optimization

## Notes

- Focus on core functionality first before adding advanced features
- Test frequently on actual iOS devices, not just simulator
- Pay special attention to notification permissions and handling
- Keep the ADHD-friendly design principles in mind throughout development
- Consider user feedback early and often during development
